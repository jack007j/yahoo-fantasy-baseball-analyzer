## üí° Best Practices

### Optimal Usage Patterns

#### Weekly Routine
1. **Sunday Evening**: Run analysis for upcoming week
2. **Monday Morning**: Make waiver claims based on results
3. **Tuesday**: Verify lineups include recommended starters
4. **Mid-week**: Re-run if probable pitchers change

#### Strategic Considerations

##### Prioritize Two-Start Pitchers
- **Higher point potential**: Double the opportunities
- **Competitive advantage**: Often overlooked by casual players
- **Risk management**: One bad start offset by another

##### Consider Matchup Quality
- **Opponent strength**: Weak offenses = better opportunities
- **Ballpark factors**: Pitcher-friendly parks boost performance
- **Weather conditions**: Wind and temperature affect outcomes

##### Balance Risk vs. Reward
- **High-floor options**: Reliable veterans for consistent points
- **High-ceiling picks**: Young players with breakout potential
- **Streaming strategy**: Different approaches for different weeks

#### League-Specific Strategies

##### Deep Leagues (12+ teams)
- **Lower ownership thresholds**: More players are rostered
- **Focus on matchups**: Quality becomes more important
- **Handcuff strategy**: Roster backup options

##### Shallow Leagues (8-10 teams)
- **Higher standards**: Only elite options worth rostering
- **Streaming focus**: Constantly churn for best matchups
- **Injury replacements**: Quick pivots when starters get hurt

### Data Interpretation Tips

#### Ownership Percentages
- **0-25%**: Deep sleepers, high risk/reward
- **25-50%**: Solid options, moderate risk
- **50-75%**: Popular picks, lower upside
- **75%+**: Widely owned, limited availability

#### Second Start Probability
- **"Likely"**: High confidence, prioritize these
- **"Possible"**: Monitor for confirmation
- **"Unlikely"**: Single start expected

#### Recommendation Priorities
1. **Two-start pitchers with good matchups**
2. **Single-start aces against weak opponents**
3. **Streaming options in pitcher-friendly parks**
4. **Injury replacements for roster stability**
